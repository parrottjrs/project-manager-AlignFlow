# AlignFlow

AlignFlow is a project management app that was done in preparation for an interview. It was created using the following tools:

- NextJS
- AWS Amplify
- Cognito
- DynamoDB
- some MUI elements

## Features

- Create a secure account and login/logout using Cognito
- Create, read, update, and delete projects and tasks
- See the number of tasks in each project, and project status (progress) based on number of completed tasks vs those which are labeled 'to do' or 'in progress'
- Sort tasks by due date and filter by meaningful keywords (status, priority)
